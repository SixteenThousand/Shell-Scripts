### My Shell Scripts
This repo is just made of the little shell scripts I write that make life a bit 
easier. They may depend on other command-line tools (fzf, git, etc.).
Unfortunately, I not been able to make the linux as yet, so it's all powershell 
scripts here.
Go have a look at ![Yona](https://github.com/SixteenThousand/Yona) if you want 
to see a shell script that does something more interesting.
